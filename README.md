## Why I made this site

This project was made so that I can properly showcase my skills using third-party API's. Within this Work-Day Scheduler, I implimented JQuery, Bootstrap, and Day.js to help my project function properly. When the user enters the this site, Day.js is being implemented to show the user the current day and time. Alongside being shown the current date, the user is met with multiple containers that are split up by the hour and can be utilized to stored tasks and to-do items for those current items. The save button allows the user to save their text input to local storage so that their data is saved and remembered. Each time container will also be color coded to the time to show whether that time slot is either in the past, in the future, or within that current hour. Utilizing Bootstrap helped bring this whole project together and make it more user-friendly.

## What I learned

One main subject that learned throughout this project was how to implement Day.js and intergrate it with JQuery and web APIs to properly make all the items in my project work the way they are supposed to. I was also able to further my understanding and skills with JQuery. I was able to use JQuery to create new elements, utilize "this" in regards to specific buttons getting pressed, and further use local storage to help store user data. This project overall was a great stepping stone in furthering my coding knowledge and having more tools under my belt to implement for future projects.

## Challenges 

One big thing I struggled with in this project was utilizing Day.js to get the current time and compare it to each hour container to properly color each container. After some research, I was able to get more comfortable with using Day.js and figured out an efficient way to compare what I needed and make my code work the way I needed.
